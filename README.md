Eltako Automation
=================

My house is equiped with the following modules:
  - 1 x [FAM14](https://www.eltako.com/en/product/professional-smart-home-en/series-14-rs485-bus-rail-mounted-devices-for-the-centralised-wireless-building-installation/fam14/)
  - 4 x [F4SR14-LED](https://www.eltako.com/en/product/professional-smart-home-en/series-14-rs485-bus-rail-mounted-devices-for-the-centralised-wireless-building-installation/f4sr14-led/)

This project connects to the serial port exposed by FAM14.

This project allows to toggle the state of a light, it also allows to read the state of the light.

THis project is based on the work of [luchermans](https://github.com/luchermans/el-tako_home).
